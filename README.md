# Modern Java Web App Patterns

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of patterns and best practices for building modern Java web applications. The patterns are designed to be used with the [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/) and [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/), but can be adapted to other frameworks and cloud providers. 

This project has [a companion article in the Azure Architecture Center](TODO:) that describes design patterns and best practices. Here's an outline of the contents in this readme:

## Architecture

Contoso Fiber aligned to a hub and spoke network topology in the production deployment architecture to centralize common resources. This network topology provided cost savings, enhanced security, and facilitated network integration (platform and hybrid):

## Steps to deploy the reference implementation

The following detailed deployment steps assume you are using a Dev Container inside Visual Studio Code.

> For your convenience, we use Dev Containers with a fully-featured development environment. If you prefer to use another editor, we recommend installing the necessary [dependencies](./prerequisites.md) and skip to the deployment instructions starting in [Step 3](#3-log-in-to-azure).

### 1. Clone the repo

> For Windows users, we recommend using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to [improve Dev Container performance](https://code.visualstudio.com/remote/advancedcontainers/improve-performance).

```pwsh
wsl
```

Clone the repository and open the project using the Dev Container.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Azure/modern-web-app-pattern-java

cd modern-web-app-pattern-java
```

### 2. Open Dev Container in Visual Studio Code

If required, ensure Docker Desktop is started. Open the repository folder in Visual Studio Code. You can do this from the command prompt:

```shell
code .
```

Once Visual Studio Code is launched, you should see a popup allowing you to click on the button **Reopen in Container**.

![Reopen in Container](docs/assets/vscode-reopen-in-container.png)

If you don't see the popup, open the Visual Studio Code Command Palette to execute the command. There are three ways to open the command palette:

- For Mac users, use the keyboard shortcut ⇧⌘P
- For Windows and Linux users, use Ctrl+Shift+P
- From the Visual Studio Code top menu, navigate to View -> Command Palette.

Once the command palette is open, search for `Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`.

### 3. Login to Azure

Before deploying, you must be authenticated to Azure and have the appropriate subscription selected. Run the following command to authenticate:

```shell
az login
```

If you have multiple tenants, you can use the following command to log into the tenant:

```shell
az login --tenant <tenant-id>
```

Set the subscription to the one you want to use (you can use [az account list](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/account?view=azure-cli-latest#az-account-list) to list available subscriptions):

```shell
export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<your-subscription-id>"
```

```pwsh
az account set --subscription $AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
```

Use the next command to login with the Azure Dev CLI (AZD) tool:

```pwsh
azd auth login
```

If you have multiple tenants, you can use the following command to log into the tenant:

```pwsh
azd auth login --tenant-id <tenant-id>
```

### 4. Create a new environment

Next we provide the AZD tool with variables that it uses to create the deployment. The first thing we initialize is the AZD environment with a name.

The environment name should be less than 18 characters and must be comprised of lower-case, numeric, and dash characters (for example, `contosowebapp`).  The environment name is used for resource group naming and specific resource naming.

```shell
azd env new <pick_a_name>
```

Select the subscription that will be used for the deployment:

```shell
azd env set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID $AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
```

Set the Azure region to be used:

```shell
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION <pick_a_region>
```

Optional: Set the App Registration Service management reference:

```shell
azd env set AZURE_SERVICE_MANAGEMENT_REFERENCE <service_management_reference>
```

### 5. Build the applications

Run the following command to build the applications:

```shell
./mvnw clean install
```

### 6. Create the Azure resources and deploy the code

Run the following command to create the Azure resources and deploy the code (about 15-minutes to complete):

```shell
azd up
```

### 7. Tear down the deployment

Run the following command to tear down the deployment:

```
azd down --purge --force
```
